# ðŸŽ­ Mood Classification with CNN  

A deep learning project that classifies moods as **Happy ðŸ˜Š** or **Sad ðŸ˜¢** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.  
Built with **TensorFlow/Keras** and deployed using **Gradio** for an interactive web demo.  

---

## ðŸš€ Features  
- CNN trained on custom Happy/Sad dataset.  
- Data augmentation for better generalization.  
- Early stopping & model checkpointing.  
- Interactive Gradio web app with image upload.  
- Confidence-based predictions with emoji labels.

## âš¡ Demo  
Run in **Google Colab**:  
1. Mount Google Drive and load dataset.  
2. Train the CNN or load saved model.  
3. Launch Gradio interface for predictions.  

---

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture  
- Conv2D â†’ MaxPooling (x3)  
- Dense (256) + Dropout (0.4)  
- Dense (1, sigmoid)  

Optimizer: `Adam` | Loss: `binary_crossentropy` | Metrics: `accuracy`  

---

## ðŸ“Š Results  
- Training accuracy improves steadily with augmentation.  
- Confidence scores displayed for both moods.  

---

## ðŸŽ¨ Gradio App UI  
- Upload a face image.  
- Get real-time classification: **ðŸ˜Š Happy / ðŸ˜¢ Sad**.  
- Confidence scores shown for transparency.  

---

## ðŸ”§ Setup Instructions  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mood-classification-cnn.git
cd mood-classification-cnn
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

Or run directly in **Google Colab** (recommended).
